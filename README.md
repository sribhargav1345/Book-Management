# IIT Bhilai BookHive (Library Management)

**Live Link:** https://book-management-mauve.vercel.app/

**About this project:**

* I have used Tech Stack of ReactJS, Bootstrap for frontend and MongoDB, Nodejs, Expressjs for Backend for making this website
   
* This website generally consists of 2 types of users:
   
     - Normal User (Users can signup and login)
     - Admin
       
* Admin credentials for login:
     - Email: library@gmail.com
     - Password: qwerty12
       
* User credentials for login:
     - Email: sribhargav@gmail.com
     - Password: 12345678

* I have implemented the Pagination technique to reduce the complexity in a single page. Also there is a search functionality (users can search with any attribute of a book like name, author, genre).

* For Admin, I have given the following features
    - Addition of Books
    - Editing the details of Books, once added
    - Deleting the book, if it is out of stock
    - Issual of Books	(Books issue by users)
    - Return of Books	 (Books return by users)

* The algorithms written, make sure that the book issue and return take place successfully, with error handling.

* For the Login and Signup purpose. I have implemented the JWT system in the backend. Also, I am going to implement Google OAuth for simple Authentication purposes.
